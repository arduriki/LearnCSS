CONCEPTS
Use tags or classes to select. Rather than id.
###
tag, tag {} -> Two selections.
###
tag tag {} -> Nested selection.
-> It's better to use a class instead.
###
Universal selector -> *
It doesn't use heritance selection, it applies to all elements.
###
CSS is a cascading language: whatever is written last, will stay.
###
Especificity -> elements < class < ids
###
! sign after the attribute, marks as important. But it's better not to do it.

Color properties:
background == background-color
rgba -> plus transparency (0 to 1)
hex: #RRGGBB
hsl = hue saturation lightness.
Color pallette: hover over the box color in order to select the color prefered.
###

Pixels is the common units size to use.
16px of font-size, is the browser's default.
- Don't set the font-size, we want to allow users to handle it with the browser.

Regarding the width, is better to not set it for the whole page. Rather set it for every element. This way, 100% (default) is the whole width. Whereas 50% is half of it.

Percentage is commonly used for sizes.

font-size: 1rem(default) one root element.
2rem is the double.

em can be used for padding in the elements.

ch = characters
- Use it in the width in order to determine where to wrap the text.

###

box-sizing: border-box.
Calculate the sizes that we assign. Doesn't include the margin in the calculation.

outline: doesn't take up space.
outline-offset
auto for left and right to center the content horizontally.
